## 🚀 Quick Start (For Non-Technical Users)

**One-line setup and run command:**

### Option 1: Using 1-Line Shell Script (Recommended)

#### For Mac/Linux:
```bash
./run.sh
```

If you get a "permission denied" error, run this first:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```

Or alternatively, you can run:
```bash
bash run.sh
```

#### For Windows:
```cmd
run.bat
```

### Option 2: Using npm (Alternative)
```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run setup
```

**That's it!** These scripts will:
1. Check for required dependencies (Node.js, Python, Poetry)
2. Install all dependencies automatically
3. Start both frontend and backend services
4. **Automatically open your web browser** to the application

**Requirements:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
- [Python 3](https://python.org/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

**After running, you can access:**
- Frontend (Web Interface): http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## 🛠️ Manual Setup (For Developers)

If you prefer to set up each component manually or need more control:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm for the frontend
- Python 3.8+ and Poetry for the backend

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit the .env file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data (required for stock prices, financials, etc.)
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

> **Note:** At minimum you need one LLM API key and the Financial Datasets key to run the system end-to-end.
